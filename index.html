      <div class="caption text-left">  I am about to graduate from the university and constantly pursuing my passion to keep learning new languages (through CS50, Free Code Camp), and general knowledge related to techniques in order to become a better computer programmer and pursuing the trend.<br>
<br>
  I live in the South Korea. And I've been to Australia for one year with working holiday visa. <br>
<br>
  I believed that every one needs to know about at least basic computer science and I wanted to make contents such as video or photo. That's why I chose Multi Media Engineering as my major. I’ve dabbed in many different programming languages (C, Java, C++, HTML/CSS/JavaScript, MS SQL, Python) and web development/publishing platforms (Wordpress), And I also have experience with openCV and sound engineering. Currently, I am learning computer science with CS50(Harvard online course on edx) and web development skill on Free Code Camp.<br>
<br>
  I like learning to widen my view and to become wiser and try to enjoy work that challenges me. I am constantly keeping an eye on Machine Learning, AI, VR. Recently, 'Pokémon Go' attracts me.<br>
<br>
I'd like to work in a social network company based on the online business.
I am interested in learning new technology and with the skill. I am a kind of person who likes to meet inspired people and prefers healthy life and happy family. I don't drink and I don't like entertaining at night after work. I'd rather work harder, learn more and take care of my family. To be honest, I can't say I am an expert because I couldn't help but working more than my studies at school for living. But I have a passion to learn, I feel thirsty at studying. I am motivated person who likes self-improvement.
